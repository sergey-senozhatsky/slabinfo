USAGE
===============================================================================

First, we need to collect samples that later will be pre-process and used by a
plotting program. Different scripts are used for those tasks, because the basic
design is not to stick to a one and only plotting program, but instead provide
an ability to implement support for any plotting back-end (gnuplot, PLplot,
etc.) that fits your own needs.


slabinfo-plotter.sh, thus, provides two functions:
-- it's a wrapper around slabinfo tool, that is used to collect the data
-- it's a pre-processor that is used to grep | awk | etc. collected samples in
a plotting back-end specific way


NOTE:
slabinfo tool must be patched in order to provide extended stats and infos.
Find the kernel patches in kernel_patches/ diretory.


To record samples, execute
slabinfo-plotter.sh -r FILENAME

To pre-process recorded sample execute
slabinfo-plotter.sh -p FILENANE [-b gnuplot,etc.]

-b option (as of now) is optional; by default script will try to pre-process
the samples for gnuplot.


Other options:
-n %d 	- tell slabinfo to print only %d first slabs in stats tables
-s %d	- sleep timeout between samples



The rest is handled by plotting scripts.


GENERATING A PLOT
===============================================================================

Plot generation is performed by a small scripts, each serving its own purpose.
As of now, only gnuplot supported and the following scripts are provided:

-- gnuplot-slabs.sh
   Generate plot based on "Slabs sorted by FOO" slabinfo output (both 'sort by
   loss' and 'sort by size' files)

   This script handles files with gnuplot_slabs-by-loss-* or
   gnuplot_slabs-by-size-* in their names.


-- gnuplot-totals.sh
   Generate plot based on Total "Memory usage and Loss" slabinfo output

   This script handles files with gnuplot_totals-* in their names.


-- gnuplot-totals-compare.sh
   Generate plot using two Total "Memory usage and Loss" slabinfo output files,
   so it's easier to see the differences in slabs' behaviour

   This script handles files with gnuplot_totals-* in their names.



All of gnuplot scripts have several options in common:

 -r %d,%d
 This option specifies a range of samples to be plotted. It basically scales
 the graph for more detailed investigation and at the same  helps when the
 number of samples is too high to be plotted nicely.

 -s %d,%d
 This option lets to redefine generated image width and heigh (pixels)


 -f FILE [mandatory]
 Specifies the file name to process.
 NOTE:
 gnuplot-totals-compare.sh requires two files:  -r FILEA,FILEB
